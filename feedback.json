This scheme is applied to all identified registry-related POST operations where 'X-Registry-Auth' was previously an inline parameter: '/images/create', '/images/{name}/push', '/plugins/pull', '/plugins/{name}/upgrade', '/services/create', and '/services/{id}/update'. This centralizes the definition and enforcement of registry authentication. The '/auth' endpoint, which provides identity tokens, is correctly excluded from requiring this scheme. Other specific parameters like 'registryAuthFrom' and 'rotate*Token' are not treated as general authentication and remain as inline parameters.",
