Corrected the schema type for the `buildargs` query parameter in the `/build` POST operation from `integer` to `string` with `format: json`. Defined a `registryAuth` security scheme for `X-Registry-Auth` headers in `components/securitySchemes` and applied it to relevant operations (`/images/create`, `/images/{name}/push`, `/services/create`, `/services/{id}/update`, `/plugins/pull`, `/plugins/{name}/upgrade`), replacing the explicit header parameters.

Added a global API Key security scheme (`X-API-Key` in header) to address the security requirement. Introduced a new query parameter named 'test_param' under `/components/parameters`. Fixed the 'HostConfig' schema by adding the missing 'type: object' field, as it uses 'allOf' and defines properties.
