This scheme is applied to all identified operations that require registry authentication, such as image creation, pushing, and plugin management. Global security was not applied as authentication is specific to registry-related endpoints, and the '/auth' endpoint is for credential exchange. Other scattered parameters like 'author' or 'rotateWorkerToken' were determined not to be general authentication credentials and were left as inline parameters.",
